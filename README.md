- **How long**: This course can be finished in less than two hours.

In this course, you will:

1. Create a workflow
2. Add a job
3. Add a run step
4. Merge your pull request
5. See effect of the workflow

1. Right-click **Start course** and open the link in a new tab.
2. In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.
3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the new repository's README.

### Automation with Bots
Tasks are automated using the Python Telegram Bot. Here's a brief example code snippet:

```python
import telegram
from telegram.ext import Updater, CommandHandler

bot_token = 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'

def start(update, context):
    context.bot.send_message(chat_id=update.effective_chat.id, text="Hello! Welcome to AfricaCryptoChainx!")

updater = Updater(token=bot_token, use_context=True)
dispatcher = updater.dispatcher

start_handler = CommandHandler('start', start)
dispatcher.add_handler(start_handler)

updater.start_polling()
updater.idle()
```

### Documentation and Content Creation
Comprehensive documentation is created using mdBook.
